# Forecasting-Project
This project focuses on building time-series forecasting models to project **sales**, **quantity**, and **units** for leading pharmaceutical brands in the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) over a 3-year horizon.

## Objective
To estimate future performance and market potential of pharmaceutical brands using historical brand performance data and statistical forecasting techniques.

## Project Timeline
- **Historical Data Range:** Past 5 years
- **Forecast Horizon:** 2025 to 2027

## Tools & Software

- **Pandas, Statsmodels, Prophet** – Data manipulation and forecasting
- **Excel** – Preliminary data aggregation and validation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization of trends and forecasts

## Repository Structure
- **data**: Raw pharmaceutical brand data 
- **codes**: Python file with exploratory analysis and forecasting models
- **output**: forecasted metrics for each brand for the next 3 years.

## Methodology
- Cleaned and structured historical sales/units/quantity data.
- Explored seasonality, trend, and cyclic patterns in brand performance.
- Applied time-series models such as:
  - ARIMA
  - Exponential Smoothing
- Forecasted results for each brand up to 2027.

## Key Insights
